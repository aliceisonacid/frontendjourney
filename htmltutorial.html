<h1><b><u>&hearts;Lets Begin &hearts;</b></u></h1>
<p>Soooo HTML stands for hypertext markup language. <br>
This is the construct of the page, the same way an architect<br>
comes up with blueprints, HTML is the format for what will be built.<br>

HTML consists of elements known as "tags". Tags are instructions<br>
for styling a specific part of a page. HTML is the blueprint for a building<br>
and tags are the features like windows,doors,stairs,etc.


<h2> &hearts;basic structure: </h2><br>

<li> #html <br>
   <li>#head</li> 
   <li>#title</li>
   <li>#/head</li>
   <li>#body</li>
   <li>#/body</li>
   <li>#/html</li>
   
   <p>tags have to be open and closed. Using the architecture analogy,<br>
    opening tags are where the construction of a window or door would begin <br>
    &&' closing tags are where they would end. As if measuring how wide & long it would be.<br>
   Also: Attributes. They define special features of tags.<br>
   If tags are windows and doors, then attributes are specific details<br>
   like width and height,whether the window opens or the door can lock.<br>
   <b>The particulars. All Tags have attributes. They provide information<br>
    about an element. Usually placed within the start tag. Has key/value pairs.<br>
   </b><br>





Unfortunately, tags and attributes cannot be made up.<br>
Theyre predefined by the W3C.<br>

<p>HTML has the ability to "comment out" blocks of markup -- a comment <br>
is something ignored by the browser. By commenting out markup, <br>
you are instructing the browser to ignore one or more tags. <br>
This may be useful to remove functionality, <br>
or to hide a piece of your website without deleting the code.<br>
When a web browser sees a comment, it understands it as <br>
"don't use these instructions until I say otherwise". <br>
Comments consist of an "opening" comment, <br>
and a "closing" comment---just like tags.<br>
It'll most likely show up as gray <br>
and italicized in the html code thats been written</p>



<h3> &hearts;Image Tags</h3>

<p>img src "link" alt="linklinkminkmink">


tag name is img and there are 2 attributes. src attribute specifies where<br>
to find the image and the alt tag is an alternatuve txt description<br>
and used as a back up in case the img src doesnt work.</p>

<h4> &hearts;How to change font tag and the face attribute</h4>

<p>< font face = "courier" > courierer < /font ><br>
< font size = "8"> next - the weeknd < /font ><br>
< font color = "hot pink"> weird anxiety from missing him< /font ></p>


<h5> &hearts; Adding Links</h5>
<p>< a href=" httpsssss" > i h8 any guy thats not him</ a ><br>
    the href attribute is the destination of the link.</p>

    <li>Sidebar: < a href= ____ "target="_____.com"> is how you set up links that open new webpages <br></li>
</p>
